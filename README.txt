STAE is a library group that is written for C99 to add what I personally need for game developement

1) Simple types
    - Renames stdint types to shorthand [uif][8|16|32|64]
        - f only for 32/64 widths
2) Dynamic Arrays
    - Generic functionality for User defined dynamic arrays of primitive and complex types
        - Credit to Tsoding's NOB for his dynamic array implementation, this is based off that heavily
